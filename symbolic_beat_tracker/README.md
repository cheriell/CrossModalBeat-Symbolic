## Dataset

Since the Maz-5 dataset is not publicly available, we provide a trianing pipeline for the [ASAP dataset](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/asap-dataset). We use the [v1.2 release](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/asap-dataset/releases) of the ASAP dataset.

For the dataset split, please refer to `../ASAP_dataset_split.ipynb`
